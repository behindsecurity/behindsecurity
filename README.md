Hi there. My name's Guilherme, and I'm a pentester. My main focus is on breaking stuff, but I also build [web applications](https://github.com/Infomundi-Project/website), [tools](https://github.com/behindsecurity/convert-to-webp), and, sometimes, [discord bots](https://github.com/behindsecurity/bingobot) and [other things](https://github.com/behindsecurity/phpipam-rce-authenticated) too, because you need to know how something works to know how to break it.

I also like sharing knowledge through [articles](https://behindsecurity.com/categories/articles/) and [writeups](https://behindsecurity.com/categories/writeups/).
