Hi there. My name is Guilherme Alves, and I'm an Offensive Security professional specializing in penetration testing and vulnerability research, with over three years of hands-on experience exploiting complex systems across web applications, Active Directory environments, and network infrastructure. Based in Brazil (but I'm also an EU citizen), I hold multiple industry certifications including HTB CPTS, THM PT1, eJPT and CompTIA Security+, and have successfully compromised over 250 vulnerable systems (Hack The Box machines) throughout my career. I'm also currently pursuing the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.
